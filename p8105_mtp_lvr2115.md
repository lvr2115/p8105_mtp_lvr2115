# Introduction

The data are from Change of Address (COAs) forms received by USPS in NYC
between 2018 and 2022. They include the total number of COAs to and from
each NYC zip code for each month of those 5 years. These COAs are filed
by people who are moving to ensure that mail is delivered to their new
address. The goal of this report is to import and tidy the data, and
then complete some exploratory analysis and visualizations for it.

## Problem-1

A dataset with neighborhood data called `zipcodes` is imported to
clarify where borough and county names may differ. A new variable
`borough` is created in this dataset to accurately reflect the borough
each zipcode is located in.

``` r
zipcodes = 
  read_csv("./zip codes.csv") |> #import dataset
  janitor::clean_names() |> #clean var names
  mutate(
    borough = recode(county_name, 
                     "Bronx" = "The Bronx",
                     "Kings" = "Brooklyn",
                     "New York" = "Manhattan",
                     "Richmond" = "Staten Island") #create borough var based on county
)
```

    ## Rows: 324 Columns: 7
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (4): County Name, County Code, File Date, Neighborhood
    ## dbl (3): State FIPS, County FIPS, ZipCode
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Each sheet containing COA data from each year is exported and variable
names cleaned. Variables `total_perm_in` and `total_perm_out`indicate
the total number of permanent address changes going into and out of each
zip code.

``` r
coa_2018 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./USPS CHANGE OF ADDRESS NYC.xlsx", sheet = "2018") |> #import dataset
  janitor::clean_names() #clean var names
  
coa_2019 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./USPS CHANGE OF ADDRESS NYC.xlsx", sheet = "2019") |> #import dataset
  janitor::clean_names()  #clean var names
   
coa_2020 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./USPS CHANGE OF ADDRESS NYC.xlsx", sheet = "2020") |> #import dataset
  janitor::clean_names() #clean var names

coa_2021 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./USPS CHANGE OF ADDRESS NYC.xlsx", sheet = "2021") |> #import dataset
  janitor::clean_names() #clean var names

coa_2022 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./USPS CHANGE OF ADDRESS NYC.xlsx", sheet = "2022") |> #import dataset
  janitor::clean_names() #clean var names
```

A new variable called `net_change`is created that subtracts each
`total_perm_out` from each `total_perm_in` value to reflect the increase
or decrease in COAs that month and year. `month_num` is renamed as
`month`, recoded as a factor variable and replaced with month names.
Variable `year` is created by separating `month` into year, name of
month, and day. Then, all of the annual COAs data from years 2018 and
2022 were bound together using `bind_rows` into a dataset called
`combined_coa`. `zipcode` was re-named to `zip_code` to match `zipcodes`
and allow for merging.

``` r
combined_coa =
    bind_rows(coa_2018, coa_2019, coa_2020,coa_2021,coa_2022) |> 
  separate(month, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |> #create year variable
  rename(month = month_num) |> #rename month 
  rename("zip_code"="zipcode") |> #rename zipcode
  mutate(
  net_change = total_perm_in - total_perm_out, #Create net_change var 
  month = case_match(month, #rename month variable with month names
      1 ~ "January",
      2 ~ "February",
      3 ~ "March",
      4 ~ "April",
      5 ~ "May",
      6 ~ "June",
      7 ~ "July",
      8 ~ "August",
      9 ~ "September",
      10 ~ "October",
      11 ~ "November",
      12 ~ "December"),
  month = as.factor(month) #recode as factor variable
) 
```

``` r
merged_coazips = 
  inner_join(zipcodes, combined_coa, by="zip_code") |> #merge COA with zipcode datasets 
  select(everything(), -county_name, -state_fips, -file_date, -day, -starts_with("county")) 

str(merged_coazips) 
```

    ## tibble [12,085 × 9] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ zip_code      : num [1:12085] 10451 10451 10451 10451 10451 ...

    ##  $ net_change    : num [1:12085] -70 -25 -15 -27 -12 29 49 39 59 -2 ...

The final tidy dataset `merged_coazips` has 12085 observations and 9
variables and tells us about the net change in COAs for a given year
from years 2018 to 2022.

In the merged dataset total, there are 237 zipcodes found and 43 unique
neighborhoods.

### This table shows the most common cities represented in the data from Manhattan.

``` r
merged_coazips |> 
  filter(borough %in% c("Manhattan")) |>
  count(city) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(1:6) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| city             |    n | rank |
|:-----------------|-----:|-----:|
| NEW YORK         | 3477 |    1 |
| BRONX            |   60 |    2 |
| BROOKLYN         |   59 |    3 |
| CANAL STREET     |    4 |    4 |
| ROOSEVELT ISL    |    4 |    4 |
| ROOSEVELT ISLAND |    4 |    4 |

Manhattan is in New York City and everyone who selected Manhattan should
have New York as its city. While its the most common city, 60 and 59
COAs have Bronx and Brookyln respectively as their city within
Manhattan, which is not accurate.

### This table shows the most common cities represented in the data from Queens.

``` r
merged_coazips |> 
  filter(borough %in% c("Queens")) |>
  count(city) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(1:5) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| city           |   n | rank |
|:---------------|----:|-----:|
| JAMAICA        | 372 |    1 |
| FLUSHING       | 309 |    2 |
| ASTORIA        | 230 |    3 |
| QUEENS VILLAGE | 165 |    4 |
| BAYSIDE        | 135 |    5 |

Jamaica, Flushing, and Astoria are the top 3 cities represented in
Brookyln COAs. These are all neighborhoods within the borough, not
cities, and are not accurate data points.

# There are 60 months between 2018 and 2022, but many ZIP codes have fewer than 60 observations; most of these are also missing neighborhood values. Discuss why this might be the case, using a few concrete examples as illustration.

## Problem-2

Across all boroughs, except Staten Island, the absolute average change
in COAs is the highest in 2020, showing an increase in people moving out
of NYC in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

``` r
merged_coazips |>
  group_by(borough, year) |>
  summarize(mean_net_change = mean(net_change)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = mean_net_change
  ) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'borough'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| borough       |   2018 |   2019 |    2020 |   2021 |   2022 |
|:--------------|-------:|-------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|
| Brooklyn      | -46.18 | -51.68 | -110.67 | -76.84 | -55.38 |
| Manhattan     | -39.80 | -52.54 | -127.70 | -39.47 | -46.18 |
| Queens        | -25.71 | -28.09 |  -46.55 | -43.30 | -29.28 |
| Staten Island |  -9.85 |  -9.12 |  -10.54 | -22.55 | -16.30 |
| The Bronx     | -46.30 | -48.02 |  -72.65 | -66.10 | -53.19 |

This table shows the five lowest values of average change in COAs and
they are all negative values. The zipcodes are all in the neighborhoods
Gramercy Park/Murray Hill and the Lower East Side. These experienced the
highest number of move-outs relative to move-ins. These are all at the
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic between May-July 2020.

``` r
merged_coazips |>
  arrange(net_change) |>
  slice(1:5) |>
  select(zip_code, neighborhood, month, year, net_change) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| zip_code | neighborhood                  | month | year | net_change |
|---------:|:------------------------------|:------|-----:|-----------:|
|    10022 | Gramercy Park and Murray Hill | May   | 2020 |       -983 |
|    10009 | Lower East Side               | July  | 2020 |       -919 |
|    10016 | Gramercy Park and Murray Hill | June  | 2020 |       -907 |
|    10016 | Gramercy Park and Murray Hill | July  | 2020 |       -855 |
|    10009 | Lower East Side               | June  | 2020 |       -804 |

This table shows the five highest values of average change in COAs
before 2020, showing neighborhoods that experienced the most move-ins
relative to move-outs. These highest values are in April-July 2018 and
range from neighborhoods in Queens, Manhattan and Brookyln.

``` r
merged_coazips |>
  filter(year < 2020) |>
  arrange(desc(net_change)) |>
  slice(1:5) |>
  select(zip_code, neighborhood, month, year, net_change) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| zip_code | neighborhood        | month | year | net_change |
|---------:|:--------------------|:------|-----:|-----------:|
|    11101 | Northwest Queens    | April | 2018 |        360 |
|    11101 | Northwest Queens    | June  | 2018 |        344 |
|    11101 | Northwest Queens    | May   | 2018 |        300 |
|    10001 | Chelsea and Clinton | July  | 2018 |        225 |
|    11201 | Northwest Brooklyn  | April | 2018 |        217 |

This plot shows neighborhood-level average net_change values against
month over all five years across the boroughs.

``` r
neighborhood_avg_plot =
  merged_coazips |> 
  group_by(borough, neighborhood, month, year) |> 
  summarize(avg_net_change = mean(net_change, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'borough', 'neighborhood', 'month'. You can
    ## override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
neighborhood_avg_plot |>
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.name, ordered = TRUE)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = avg_net_change, color = borough, group = neighborhood)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~borough) +
  labs(
    x = "Month", 
    y = "Average Net Change",
    title = "Neighborhood-Level Average Net Change Over Time"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```
